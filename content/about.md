### About

Krystal Rose Ledoux is an artist that paints in acrylic and oil.  She was born and currently resides in the suburbs of Philly.  She earned her BA in fine arts from Albright College and a MFA in painting from Marywood University.  After having her first solo show at Paper-kite Gallery she took a long break from painting to raise her daughter.  As her daughter grew up she finally found herself with a paintbrush again with the idea for her current series, using her daughter as inspiration.
